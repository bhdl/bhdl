#+TITLE: Rackematic: a framework for Schematic/PCB design

* KiCAD
- file formats: http://www.kicad-pcb.org/help/file-formats/

* Design

- A language for modeling schematic components
- A visualizer

** IC
An IC should have the following informations:
- pins
- index mapping of pins (HEBI: would the mapping be the same for
  symbol and footprint?)
- symbol: and location of pins on the symbol
- footprint: and location of pins on the footprint

A component should have:
- pins
- children components
- the connections

Position of IC on gerber files:
- I should be able to specify a coordinate of a IC?
- should I specify the location for all ICs?
- how about schematic symbols?
- how about another coordinate system, like relative positioning?
- I probably want to just use the PCB layout, no visualizing of the
  schematic at all

If position (and orientation) is fixed, the component is no longer
reusable. Well, it is reusable by providing parameter for all the
fixed locations.

** Visualizer
Like the schematic wire connection using labels, I probably don't want
to connect every components physically.

** Gerber file generation
gerber file format
- website: https://www.ucamco.com/en/gerber
- specification:
  https://www.ucamco.com/files/downloads/file/81/the_gerber_file_format_specification.pdf
- online Reference Gerber Viewer: https://gerber-viewer.ucamco.com/

from computer-aided design (CAD) to computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)

*** %% commands
All commands must be =%...*%= format.

Declaring commands, can appear only once:
- FS :: format specification
  - %FSLAX26Y26*%: 2 digit integer part, 6 digit decimal part. The
    *leading* 0s are omitted.
- MO :: set mode. %MOMM*%: set the unit to MM or (IN)

Mode
- LP :: Load polarity. %LPD%, %LPC%: set the polarity to either dark
  or clear. The polarity is used for either clear a region or darken
  it. Since the gerber file interprets as superimposing in the order
  of generation, the later image overwrites the former.
- LM :: Load mirror
- LR :: load rotation
- LS :: load scale


Aperture:
  - AD :: aperture define. %AD%: Aperture define.
    - standard pre-defined appentures: 
      - circle (C), diameter, [hole diameter]
      - rectangle (R), X, Y, [hole diameter]
      - obround (O), X, Y, [hole diameter]
      - regular polygon (P), outer diameter, #vertices, rotation, [hole diameter]
    - ADDnn,2.5X.25X.01*
    - %ADD123R,2.5X1.5*%: create an aperture with D-code D123, use
      pre-defined aperture R, parameter is 2.5mmX1.5mm for the
      rectangle. A single =D100*= command can be used to set the
      aperture.
  - AM :: Aperture macro.  %AM%: Aperture Macro, creates macro
    apertures, used for custom shapes. This does not associate the
    aperture with a D-code, another AD should be used (TODO examples).
    - %AM<name>*...*...*%, one * per-line
    - TODO
  - AB :: Aperture block. %AB%: Aperture block, creates block
    apertures.
  - SR :: Step and repeat. Seems to be another block creation command

Attributes (X2: TF, TA, TO, TD):
- TF :: attribute File. 
  - %TF.FileFunction,Soldermask,Top*%: the file represents the top
    solder mask
  - %TF.Part,Other,example*%
- TA :: attribute Aperture
- TO :: attribute Object
- TD :: attribute Delete

*** non-%% commands
All commands must be =...*= format.

- G04: line comment
- M02 :: end of file

Graphical commands:
- G01 :: set interpolation mode to linear
- G02 :: set interpolation mode to clockwise circular
- G03 :: set interpolation mode to counter-clockwise circular
- G74 :: set quadrant mode to single quadrant
- G75 :: set quadrant mode to multi quadrant

Operations: X...Y...D01. The coordinates can be negative. The X or Y
section can be omitted to use the current value.
- D02 :: move the current point to the coordinate
- D01 :: create a straight or circular line from current point to the
  coordinate. Usually used for tracks.
  - The only allowed apertures are pre-defined solid circle and
    rectangle. custom apertures are not allowed.
  - Only circle can be used for arc. This can be achieved by D01 in
    "circular interpolation mode".
  - a circle with 0 diameter can be used to draw non-image
    information, e.g. an outline.
  - a draw of 0 length is allowed, and appears the same as flash, but
    DO NOT USE THIS, in particular a pad should only be flashed.
- D03 :: create a flash object. Each aperture has an origin, and that is
  positioned at the coordinate. Usually used for pads.

Region statement, used for pour. A region is defined by its contour.
- G36 command begins a region statement, G37 ends it. 
- In between G36 and G37, D01 draws the region, and D02 ENDS it. 
  - D02 is not allowed if the drawing of this region is not closed, so
    D02 basically declares an end of one region, and starts
    another. 
  - That is, G36 G37 can define multiple sub regions. G37 ends the
    region statement, the last one needs not be closed by D02.
- when a region is ended with G37, all sub regions are filled. I guess
  for a pour fill, it should be performs first.

*** Formal grammar

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<data block> ::= <character>* '*'
<command> ::= <function code command> | <extended command>
<function code command> ::= <data block>

;; the multiple data block case is AM command
<extended command> ::= %<data block>+%

<extended command> :== <FS command> | ...
<FS command> ::= FSLAX<digit><digit>Y<digit><digit> '*'
#+END_EXAMPLE

<extended command> ::= %<data block>+%

** sections of schematic
*** power section
- decoupling capacitors
- voltage divider resistors, selected by op-amps (e.g. LMV358) to
  select 3.3v or 5v
*** (power) LED section
- LED
- current limiting resistors

*** voltage regulator (e.g. 7805)
- decoupling capacitors on both input and output of the voltage regulator
- 3v3 volt regulator (e.g. LP2985, NCP1117)
- barrel jack for power input

Some tips:
- for linear regulator, the output capacitor should be smaller than
  the input capacitor
- the output capacitor is a filter capacitor
- the input capacitor is a decoupling capacitor, since it decouples it
  from the input power

*** reset button
- button
- pull-up resistors

*** IC
- ATMega328 (just a lot of pins)
- oscillator (crystral)

** Frequently used components
- 7805 voltage regulator
- pin headers

** Start with an Arduino Uno
- bootloader auto-reset
- USB socket
- ICSP (SPI, i.e. MISO, MOSI, SCK, RESET) header for programming the
  Arduino bootloader
- serial to USB chip (e.g. FTDI)
