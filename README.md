# BHDL: A Programming Language and System for making PCBs

BHDL is a programming language embedded in
[racket](https://racket-lang.org/). In addition to the language, the system
consists of a layout co-design system based on functional picture, REPL-driven
interactive development and visualization, libraries, KiCAD compatible exporter,
and placement engines including an optimization-based anlytical placer (ePlace)
and simulated annealing based detailed placer.
